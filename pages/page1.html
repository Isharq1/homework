        <h2>AIM, ACTIVITY, RESULT</h2>
        <p>During my time a university i completed many projects that shaped up the skills i gained from university. Below you'll find some of the project completed at university, starting with aim, how i tackled the task and the results from completing the project.</p>

            <p>•	The aim of my final year project was to model and simulate an omni-driven robot.</p>
            <p> •	During this project I had to model an Omni-driven robot using equations and mathematical proof, analysing the architecture of the Omni-driven robot by research. Use MATLAD to write a code for the kinematic equation and finally use SIMULINK to drive graphs for the movement of the robot.</p>
            <p> •	The graphs showed the achieved results to match the expected results and in was invited to present my project presentation at the final year BCU dissertation show.</p>

                  •	During my degree I had to also design, build and test a fully functioning line following robot.
                </p>
                <p>
                  •	This involved design and create a PCB schematic on Eagle, solder components on a PCB board, use SOLIDWORKS to design the chassis of the robot, use MPLABS to program the board and finally assemble and test the line follower.
                </p>
                <p>
                  •	The results showed that the robot followed the line set out without any hesitation earning me 93% for this project.
